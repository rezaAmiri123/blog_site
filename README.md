This project has being developed for test that I'm learning.
It is important for me to learn Django framework.

This project has been covered some section, for example:
1 - django for backend
2 - html, css, javascript for frontend section
3 - docker for container section
4 - nginx for reverse proxy server
5 - postgres for database server

The backend section covers some section, for example:
1 - sitemap
2 - feed
3 - It has Action app to save users actions
4 - It has Account app to register users and working with profile managment
5 - It has blog app to create some post and comment 
The project is't complete and I'm working to add something to that
