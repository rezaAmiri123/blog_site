This project has being developed for test that I'm learning.
It is important for me to learn Django framework.

1 - django for backend

2 - html, css, javascript for frontend section

3 - docker for container section

4 - nginx for reverse proxy server

5 - postgres for database server

6 - Gunicron is used for wsgi server

The backend section covers some section, for example:

1 - sitemap

2 - feed

3 - It has Action app to save users actions

4 - It has Account app to register users and working with profile managment

5 - It has blog app to create some post and comment 

6 - There is a Images app that has bookmark. It can collect and save images in app
